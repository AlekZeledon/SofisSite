    <p>Welcome to this little website I made just for you. Above I chose a bunch of quotes that make me think of you or relate to us in some way so you can read them whenever you're either missing me, need some motivation or even just feeling a bit down. Just so anywhere you are in the world you can look at this and know that I care about you and have a little part of me with you.</p>

    <h2>&#9825 Happy 6th Anniversary! &#9825</h2>
    
    <br>

    <p>Thank you for these amazing 6 years or 2,190 days of dating and even more before that. I've cherished every single one and I'm thankful for every moment I've been able to form a new memory with you in it. Ever since I met you on Omegle I had a good feeling about you and felt a weird connection with you as if I had known you forever and even told you I always thought of you as my girlfriend even when we were still friends. So possibly deep in my heart I always knew we were meant to be or that you were my soulmate and loved you before I even knew it. Talking to you was the best decision I ever made and I would have gone on foot to meet you if there was no other way because you're worth the world to me. You've always understood me more than anyone ever could and I couldn't have asked for a better friend and you'll always be my #1 best friend and I'll always be your #1 biggest fan. I admire you so much and love everything that you are and who you've become over the years and have always been so proud of you for all the challenges you've gotten through and all the future goals I know you're gonna achieve and I hope to be there along the way. You can always count on me for anything and everything and I'll always be here for you and ready to give you my unlimited attention or even just be a shoulder to cry on or hype you up when you're feeling down. I'm always just a call away and I promise you that forever. You're the best girlfriend and companion I could have ever asked for and I'm incredibly grateful for every second we've been able to spend together. I've had the time of my life going on all our trips together and equally loved all our little dates and even just the times when we've cuddled in bed together watching movies and I want our life together to be filled with all those things forever. You're seriously the best and I can't thank you enough for everything we've experienced together. I love you Sofi. I love you from head to toe, and inside out. I love your adorable laugh and your soft beautiful voice that fills me up with joy just at the sound of the very first word you say. I love your unique, sweet and spoiled but sassy personality due to the supposed Cancer and Slytherin in you. I love you because you are my rose and have always and will always love you through the bad and the good and no matter what the world throws at us. And if you let me, I'll keep loving you for 6 and many many more years to come.</p>
